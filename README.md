This repo is for the R exercises in the lecture "Overview of Data Science" (Common Graduate Courses) for graduate students at Kyoto University. The lecture slides and R Markdown files used in the class are available in this repo.


You can use RStudio via "Binder", which provides an RStudio environment by clicking on the banner above. It is recommended to use your own PC for full-scale calculations. Binder should be used only for test purposes.
